abstract: 'Traits are patterns of brain signals and behaviors that are stable over
  time but differ across individuals, whereas states are phasic patterns that vary
  over time, are influenced by the environment, yet oscillate around the traits. The
  quality of a social interaction depends on the traits and states of the interacting
  agents. However, it remains unclear how to decipher both traits and states from
  the same set of brain signals. To explore the hidden neural traits and states in
  relation to the behavioral ones during social interactions, we developed a pipeline
  to extract latent dimensions of the brain from electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected
  during a team flow task. Our pipeline involved two stages of dimensionality reduction:
  first, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), followed by linear discriminant
  analysis (LDA). This pipeline resulted in an interpretable, seven-dimensional EEG
  latent space that revealed a trait-state hierarchical structure, with macro-segregation
  capturing neural traits and micro-segregation capturing neural states. Out of the
  seven latent dimensions, we found that three that significantly contributed to variations
  across individuals and task states. Using representational similarity analysis,
  we mapped the EEG latent space to a skill-cognition space, establishing a connection
  between hidden neural signatures and social interaction behaviors. Our method demonstrates
  the feasibility of representing both traits and states within a single model that
  correlates with changes in social behavior.'
