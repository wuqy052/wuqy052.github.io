abstract: How do large-scale brain networks dynamically reorganize to support different
  types of decision-making with distinct yet overlapping cognitive demands? While
  we often make decisions by evaluating and choosing from a set of externally defined
  choice options, we can also generate options internally from our existing knowledge
  store. Such flexibility suggests the ability for decision-related brain networks
  to reconfigure in response to the need to recruit sensory processing and semantic
  retrieval modules to evaluate externally and internally generated options, respectively.
  Here we sought to test this hypothesis by applying graph-theoretic tools to functional
  neuroimaging data obtained for (i) decisions with externally provided options (external-menu
  choices/EMC); (ii) decisions with self-generated options (internal-menu choices/IMC);
  and (ii) a semantic fluency condition in which individuals generated but were not
  required to evaluate options (semantic fluency; SF). Using categorical multi-slice
  community detection, we found that variations in cognitive demands across the tasks
  were associated with distinct reconfigurations of hierarchically organized modular
  brain networks. Specifically, global network organization that differed primarily
  along the dimension of external visual/sensory input distinguished EMC from both
  of the internally oriented tasks (IMC and SF). At submodular levels, IMC was distinguished
  from SF by stronger interactions between presumptive semantic retrieval and valuation
  networks hypothesized to support the generation and evaluation of choice options.
  These findings are consistent with a hierarchical architecture in which modules
  at multiple levels interact to support adaptive decision-making.
