abstract: 'Our eyes are constantly moving, and where we look reveals what we attend
  to, influences the decisions we make, and what we remember. While traditional laboratory-based
  eye-tracking protocols have generated a large body of findings based on well-controlled
  stimuli, modern methods now offer the ability to collect gaze data at much larger
  scale and with more naturalistic stimuli. Powerful computational tools also enable
  new analyses of high-dimensional data, incorporating feature annotation of the stimuli
  and model-based evaluation of gaze. These advances in both data collection and analysis
  are providing new insights into individual differences in both health and disease.
  Here we discuss four key approaches to modeling eye movement data: saliency-based
  attention phenotyping, data-driven gaze pattern identification, supervised machine
  learning classification, and unsupervised clustering. We highlight their advantages
  in psychiatry research, as they inform better understanding of visual attention,
  provide more fine-grained characterization of individual differences, and make more
  powerful clinical predictions. Finally, we address key methodological considerations
  in applying the methods and take stock of future opportunities on the horizon.'
