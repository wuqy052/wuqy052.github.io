abstract: 'To navigate our complex social world, it is crucial to deploy multiple
  learning strategies, such as learning from directly experiencing action outcomes
  or from observing other people’s behavior. Despite the prevalence of experiential
  and observational learning in humans and other social animals, it remains unclear
  how people favor one strategy over the other depending on the environment, and how
  individuals vary in their strategy use. Here, we describe an arbitration mechanism
  in which the prediction errors associated with each learning strategy influence
  their weight over behavior. We designed an online behavioral task to test our computational
  model, and found that while a substantial proportion of participants relied on the
  proposed arbitration mechanism, there was some meaningful heterogeneity in how people
  solved this task. Four other groups were identified: those who used a fixed mixture
  between the two strategies, those who relied on a single strategy and non-learners
  with irrelevant strategies. Furthermore, groups were found to differ on key behavioral
  signatures, and on transdiagnostic symptom dimensions, in particular autism traits
  and anxiety. Together, these results demonstrate how large heterogeneous datasets
  and computational methods can be leveraged to better characterize individual differences.'
