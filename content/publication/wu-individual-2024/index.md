abstract: 'The ability to infer the goals and intentions of others is crucial for
  social interactions, and such social capabilities are broadly distributed across
  individuals. Autism-like traits (that is, traits associated with autism spectrum
  disorder (ASD)) have been associated with reduced social inference, yet the underlying
  computational principles and social cognitive processes are not well characterized.
  Here we tackle this problem by investigating inference during social learning through
  computational modeling in two large cross-sectional samples of adult participants
  from the general population (N1 = 943, N2 = 352). Autism-like traits were extracted
  and isolated from other associated symptom dimensions through a factor analysis
  of the Social Responsiveness Scale. Participants completed an observational learning
  task to quantify the tradeoff between two social learning strategies: imitation
  (repeating the observed partner’s most recent action) and emulation (inferring the
  observed partner’s goal). Autism-like traits were associated with reduced observational
  learning specifically through reduced emulation (but not imitation), revealing difficulties
  in social goal inference (Pearson’s r = −0.124, P textless 0.001). This association
  held, even when controlling for other model parameters (for example, decision noise,
  heuristics, F1,925 = 15.352, P textless 0.001), and was specifically related to
  social difficulties in autism-like traits (F1,916 = 33.169, P textless 0.001) but
  not social anxiety traits (F1,916 = 0.005, P = 0.945). The findings, replicated
  in an additional sample, provide a powerfully specific mechanistic hypothesis for
  social learning challenges in ASD, employing a computational psychiatry approach
  that could be applied to other disorders.'
