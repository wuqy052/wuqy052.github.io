abstract: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with graph theoretical
  modeling has been increasingly applied for assessing whole brain network topological
  organization, yet its reproducibility remains controversial. In this study, we acquired
  three repeated resting-state fMRI scans from 16 healthy controls during a strictly
  controlled in-laboratory study and examined the test-retest reliability of seven
  global and three nodal brain network metrics using different data processing and
  modeling strategies. Among the global network metrics, the characteristic path length
  exhibited the highest reliability, whereas the network small-worldness performed
  the poorest. Nodal efficiency was the most reliable nodal metric, whereas betweenness
  centrality showed the lowest reliability. Weighted global network metrics provided
  better reliability than binary metrics, and reliability from the AAL90 atlas outweighed
  those from the Power264 parcellation. Although global signal regression had no consistent
  effects on the reliability of global network metrics, it slightly impaired the reliability
  of nodal metrics. These findings provide important implications for the future utility
  of graph theoretical modeling in brain network analyses.
