abstract: 'Traits are patterns of brain signals and behaviors that are stable over
  time but differ across individuals, whereas states are phasic patterns that vary
  over time, are influenced by the environment, yet oscillate around the traits. The
  quality of a social interaction depends on the traits and states of the interacting
  agents. However, it remains unclear how to decipher both traits and states from
  the same set of brain signals. To explore the hidden neural traits and states in
  relation to the behavioral ones during social interactions, we developed a pipeline
  to extract latent dimensions of the brain from electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected
  during a team flow task. Our pipeline involved two stages of dimensionality reduction:
  non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), followed by linear discriminant analysis
  (LDA). This pipeline resulted in an interpretable, seven-dimensional EEG latent
  space that revealed a trait to state (trait-state) hierarchical structure, with
  macro-segregation capturing neural traits and micro-segregation capturing neural
  states. Out of the seven latent dimensions, we found three that significantly contributed
  to variations across individuals and task states. Using representational similarity
  analysis, we mapped the EEG latent space to a skill-cognition space, establishing
  a connection between hidden neural signatures and social interaction behaviors.
  Our method demonstrates the feasibility of representing both traits and states within
  a single model that correlates with changes in social behavior.'
