  Temporal interference (TI) stimulation is a new technique of non-invasive brain
  stimulation. Envelope-modulated waveforms with two high-frequency carriers can activate
  neurons in target brain regions without stimulating the overlying cortex, which
  has been validated in mouse brains. However, whether TI stimulation can work on
  the human brain has not been 
  elucidated.textless/ptextgreatertextlessptextgreatertextlessboldtextgreaterObjective:textless/boldtextgreater
  To assess the effectiveness of the envelope-modulated waveform of TI stimulation
  on the human primary motor cortex 
  (M1).textless/ptextgreatertextlessptextgreatertextlessboldtextgreaterMethods:textless/boldtextgreater
  Participants attended three sessions of 30-min TI stimulation during a random reaction
  time task (RRTT) or a serial reaction time task (SRTT). Motor cortex excitability
  was measured before and after TI 
  stimulation.textless/ptextgreatertextlessptextgreatertextlessboldtextgreaterResults:textless/boldtextgreater
  In the RRTT experiment, only 70 Hz TI stimulation had a promoting effect on the
  reaction time (RT) performance and excitability of the motor cortex compared to
  sham stimulation. Meanwhile, compared with the sham condition, only 20 Hz TI stimulation
  significantly facilitated motor learning in the SRTT experiment, which was significantly
  positively correlated with the increase in motor evoked 
  potential.textless/ptextgreatertextlessptextgreatertextlessboldtextgreaterConclusion:textless/boldtextgreater
  These results indicate that the envelope-modulated waveform of TI stimulation has
  a significant promoting effect on human motor functions, experimentally suggesting
  the effectiveness of TI stimulation in humans for the first time and paving the
  way for further explorations.textless/ptextgreater
