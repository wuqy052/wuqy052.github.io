 abstract = {The origins of human prosociality, in particular between strangers, are multifaceted. While laboratory studies support a cost-benefit account of helping, real-life scenarios involve additional socio-emotional motives grounded in subjective intuitions. How the cost-benefit model generalizes to everyday helping behavior remains unclear. In this study, we comprehensively assessed how motivations jointly shape helping across 100 naturalistic helping scenarios: an online sample (N1 = 215) rated willingness to help after reading brief vignettes, and a subset (N2 = 140) rated the strengths of candidate motivations elicited by each scenario. Two key factors—benefit to both helper and helpee, and cost to the helper—were identified through a factor analysis of the motivation ratings. We then successfully predicted helping decisions as a linear weighted sum of the two motivational factors, along with a dispositional helping bias. While a higher helping bias was associated with greater trait agreeableness and dispositional empathy, whereas individuals who prioritized cost over benefit exhibited higher levels of punishment sensitivity. Finally, we characterized the helping scenarios in three associated spaces: a decision space (willingness to help levels), a motivation space (two key motivational factors), and a semantic space (14 semantic types). Combining computational modeling with naturalistic helping contexts, this approach provides an integrated account of prosocial motivation and clarifies how individual differences in personality map onto real-world helping behaviors.},
