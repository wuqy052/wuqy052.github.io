abstract: 'In recent years, the study of the neural mechanisms underlying social behavior
  has gained significant attention within the field of neuroeconomics. During this
  time, core ideas and theoretical frameworks developed through the study of decision-making
  and learning in non-social contexts have been adapted and extended to social contexts.
  New paradigms have been introduced to measure social behaviors, new models and theories
  have been proposed to explain these behaviors, and experimental evidence has accumulated
  to validate these theories and elucidate the neural substrates underpinning social
  computations in humans.  This chapter highlights recent advances in the study of
  social processes using a neuroeconomics-based approach, focusing on important findings
  through computational modeling and neuroimaging methods. We begin by outlining the
  neural structures involved in processing various social rewards. Next, we discuss
  how values are computed and represented in the brain when making decisions that
  involve other people’s outcomes. We then examine the motivations behind these decisions,
  in two specific cases: altruistic and fairness-driven, decisions. Finally, we explore
  how individuals update their knowledge and beliefs about whom they interact with,
  and how they should interact - a process known as social learning. We categorize
  social learning into two broad types: learning about others and learning from others.'
