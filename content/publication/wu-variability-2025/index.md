abstract: 'The surge of online psychological assessments have brought the autism research
  community both opportunities and challenges: while they enable rapid large-scale
  data collection and more power to characterize individual differences, they also
  bring concerns about data quality, generalizability beyond online samples, and whether
  autistic traits can be reliably characterized with self-report measures administered
  online. Here we tackle these concerns by providing a systematic characterization
  of the autistic traits variability across individuals in a large cross-sectional
  dataset (N=2826) as well as its temporal reliability within individuals in a test-retest
  dataset (N=247), with both online and in-lab samples. We measured autistic traits
  using the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd version, Adult Self Report (SRS-2-ASR)
  - a tool that quantifies individual differences in autistic traits along a continuum
  for the general adult population. Across individuals, we found elevated SRS scores
  in online samples and were able to trace this effect to specific subsets of SRS
  items. SRS scores also covaried with internalizing symptoms, decreased with age,
  and were lower in women compared to other genders. Within individuals, we find moderate-to-good
  test-retest reliability of SRS scores over long intervals, with no difference between
  online and in-lab samples, suggesting robust temporal stability. We conclude that
  there are systematic differences in autistic traits between online and in-lab samples
  that are partly explained by systematic population-level differences in internalizing
  symptoms, particularly social anxiety. Future studies that sample across different
  populations should measure, control for, or stratify with respect to these factors.'
