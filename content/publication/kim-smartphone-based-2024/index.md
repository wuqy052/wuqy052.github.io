abstract: Atypical gaze patterns are a promising biomarker of autism spectrum disorder.
  To measure gaze accurately, however, it typically requires highly controlled studies
  in the laboratory using specialized equipment that is often expensive, thereby limiting
  the scalability of these approaches. Here we test whether a recently developed smartphone-based
  gaze estimation method could overcome such limitations and take advantage of the
  ubiquity of smartphones. As a proof-of-principle, we measured gaze while a small
  sample of well-assessed autistic participants and controls watched videos on a smartphone,
  both in the laboratory (with lab personnel) and in remote home settings (alone).
  We demonstrate that gaze data can be efficiently collected, in-home and longitudinally
  by participants themselves, with sufficiently high accuracy (gaze estimation error
  below 1Â° visual angle on average) for quantitative, feature-based analysis. Using
  this approach, we show that autistic individuals have reduced gaze time on human
  faces and longer gaze time on non-social features in the background, thereby reproducing
  established findings in autism using just smartphones and no additional hardware.
  Our approach provides a foundation for scaling future research with larger and more
  representative participant groups at vastly reduced cost, also enabling better inclusion
  of underserved communities.
