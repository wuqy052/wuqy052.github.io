abstract: Although previous studies have reported correlations between alpha oscillations
  and the “retention” subprocess of working memory (WM), causal evidence has been
  limited in human neuroscience due to the lack of delicate modulation of human brain
  oscillations. Conventional transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is
  not suitable for demonstrating the causal evidence for parietal alpha oscillations
  in WM retention because of its inability to modulate brain oscillations within a
  short period (i.e., the retention subprocess). Here, we developed an online phase-corrected
  tACS system capable of precisely correcting for the phase differences between tACS
  and concurrent endogenous oscillations. This system permits the modulation of brain
  oscillations at the target stimulation frequency within a short stimulation period
  and is here applied to empirically demonstrate that parietal alpha oscillations
  causally relate to WM retention. Our experimental design included both in-phase
  and anti-phase alpha-tACS applied to participants during the retention subprocess
  of a modified Sternberg paradigm. Compared to in-phase alpha-tACS, anti-phase alpha-tACS
  decreased both WM performance and alpha activity. These findings strongly support
  a causal link between alpha oscillations and WM retention and illustrate the broad
  application prospects of phase-corrected tACS.
