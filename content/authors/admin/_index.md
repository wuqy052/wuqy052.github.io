## Hello!

I am a 5th year PhD student in the Social and Decision Neuroscience program at Caltech, co-advised by Ralph Adolphs and John O'Doherty. 

I study human social attention and social learning using eye-tracking, behavioral modeling, and fMRI. I'm interested in understanding how people perceive and interpret the social world, and the cognitive computations underlying social inferences. 

I am always curious to explore the individual differences in people's social strategies - where they look, what they think, and how they react. A big focus of my research is to apply computational tools to characterize atypical social behaivors in psychiatric conditions, especially autism.
