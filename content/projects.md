      title: Cognitive Neuroscience * Social Processes * Psychiatry
      text: I am broadly interested in the social component of all kinds of human cognitions, such as attention, perception, learning, and decision-making. The social component can be a socially meaningful sensory stimuli, a learning task that involves the knowledge about or from another person, or a decision that is made during the interaction with others. A lot of these processes are affected in psychiatric conditions at various degrees and in various ways. Part of my research is to develop novel paradigms and computational models to characterize the challenges of social functioning in clinical populations. Most of my work so far has been focused on autism.
