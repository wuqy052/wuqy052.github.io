### An Ice Cream Decision
![ice cream problem](olel_1.png)
Imagine you are in an ice cream shop with your friend Bob, and there are 3 options: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.

- Bob has tried the chocolate one, and he decide to get it again. 
- Last time you did the strawberry one but you didnâ€™t like it
- You think that Bob and you would have the same preference.

Therefore, you decided to buy the chocolate one. 

Similar situations happens everyday. Often, we make decisions by combining self experience and information from others. In this study, I asked **what is the neuro-computations of the information integration between observational and experiential domains**.

### A Social Pearl Hunting Task
To answer the question, I designed this social pearl hunting task, adapted from a [previous task](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48548-y) by my mentor Caroline Charpentier.

In the task, participants rely on 2 sources of information in order to hunt pearls from shells:
1. Observation: a partner explore one of two corals, followed by a shell harvested from the chosen coral. The partner knows which shell is better, but they can only explore corals.
2. Experience: participant choose between two shells, and receive feedback as to whether a pearl (the reward) was inside the chosen shell.

### Disentangling Observational and Experiential Learning
Now letâ€™s define an OL strategy and an EL strategy. 
![OL strategy](olel_3.png)
Here is an OL-consistent choice: say the partner choose this coral, which generates a blue shell, next your partner repeat their choice, which means they probably want a blue shell, therefore you choose blue; but if the next time they switch to the other coral, this might indicate that they do not want blue, so you should choose yellow instead.

And for a choice to be EL-consistent, say you yourself choose blue and do not see a pearl, the next trial you should switch to yellow, and if you do see a pearl, you should stick to blue in your next trial.


### Conference Presentation
On Apr 2024, I presented the above results at the Social Affective Neuroscience Society (SANS) annual meeting as a data blitz talk titled _Neuro-computational Mechanism Of Reliability-based Arbitration Between Observational And Experiential Learning_. For more details, please check my poster below.
