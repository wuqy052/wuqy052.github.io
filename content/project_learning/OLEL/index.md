### An Ice Cream Decision
![ice cream problem](olel_1.png)
Youâ€™re at an ice cream shop with your friend Bob. There are three options: chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry.

- Bob gets chocolate again - last time he bought the chocolate one.
- You tried strawberry last time and didnâ€™t like it.
- You assume Bobâ€™s taste is similar to yours.

So, you choose chocolateâ€”based on your own experience and Bobâ€™s.

We face situations like this daily, where we blend firsthand experience with observed behavior. This study explores **the neuro-computational basis of how we integrate observational and experiential learning**.

### A Social Pearl Hunting Task
To answer the question, I designed a social pearl hunting task, adapted from [Charpentier et al., 2024 ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48548-y).

Participants gather pearls using two information sources:
1. **Observational learning (OL)**: Watch a partner choose a coral, then see the resulting shell. The partner knows which shell is better but can only choose corals.
2. **Experiential learning (EL)**: Choose a shell and receive direct feedback (pearl or not).

### Disentangling Observational and Experiential Strategies

![OL strategy](olel_3.png "OL consistent choice: the partner chooses blue-orange coral,, which generates a blue shell. next they repeat their choice, indicating their preference for a blue shell")
In an **OL-consistent choice**, one infers the preference of the partner by observing two consecutive trials - whether the partner repeat the coral choice (they want the current shell), or switch the coral choice (they want the other shell).

![EL strategy](olel_4.png "EL consistent chioce: yourself choose blue and do not see a pearl, the next trial you should switch to yellow") 
In an **EL-consistent choice**, one repeat the past choice if that choice yielded a pearl, and switch otherwise.

### Reliability-based Arbitration

![Computational framework](olel_5.png "Reliability-based arbitration model") 
We propose a **reliability-based arbitration model** to explain the decisions: 
- Two systems compute shell values using prediction errors:
  - **State Prediction Error (SPE)** for OL: mismatch between predicted and actual shell from the partnerâ€™s coral.
  - **Reward Prediction Error (RPE)** for EL: mismatch between expected and actual reward.
 - Values computed from the two systems are flexibly combined based on the reliability - a function of the prediction errors. 

### Neural Signatures of Decision Systems

Where does the brain compute these values?

![OL and EL value](olel_6.png) 
We found the OL-based decision signal in the **dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), and superior temporal gyrus (STG)**. EL-based decision value in the **ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)**.
![Integrated value](olel_7.png)
We also saw the integrated decision value in both **vmPFC and STG**.


### Conference Talk
On Apr 2024, I presented the above results at the Social Affective Neuroscience Society (SANS) annual meeting as a Data Blitz titled **_Neuro-computational Mechanism Of Reliability-based Arbitration Between Observational And Experiential Learning_**.
