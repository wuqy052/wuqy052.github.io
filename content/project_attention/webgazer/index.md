> TLDR:

> We utilized a webcam-based eye-tracking technology to characterize social attention in a large autistic population. We investigated gaze patterns while participants watch zoom recordings of group conversations.Data from a preliminary study with 97 autistic and 140 non-autistic online participants suggested that autistic individuals may be more prone to distraction by irrelevant nonsocial events. 

> A pre-registered study is still going on that aims at replicating and expanding the preliminary findings by recruiting a broader and more diverse sample of autistic and non-autistic participants. Stay tuned!

## Webcam-based Eye-tracking
Most eye-tracking studies are constrained by the need for sophisticated, expensive in-lab equipment that requires complex calibration and in-person laboratory visits. To tackle this limitation, we utilized a webcam-based eye-tracking technology named ['webgazer'](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/). 

Webgazer is a user-friendly tool for psychologists and is compatible with most computers, yet it has limited spatial and temporal resolution. Therefore, we designed a unique paradigm that features 2-by-2 grid style stimuli.

## Feature-engineered Social Conversation Videos
Perceiving and engaging in conversations are reported as key challenges by autistic people. The increasing use of new teleconferencing platforms, like Zoom, has made it more common to communicate and interact through these platforms. However, there is limited research on how autistic individuals perceive and understand online conversations.

We scripted multiple videos with different topics (e.g., group project, family chat, work conflicts) and had them performed by professional actors to incorporate social features such as turn-takings, reactions of the listeners, as well as distracting background objects. These featuers are designed to have orthogonolized timelines.

## Large-scale Assessments on Autistic Adults
We next recruited autistic and nonautistic participants through several channels: 
1. Online crowdsourcing platform - Prolific
2. Simons Foundation SPARK Database
3. Local participants in the LA area. 
Each participant watched multiple videos at home while using their own computer webcam to record their eye movements.

With some preliminary data from 97 autistic and 140 non-autistic participants, we found that 
- Overall, the data quality was good and comparable between the groups.
- Autistic individuals may be more prone to distraction by irrelevant nonsocial events in our video stimuli.

In May 2024, I presented these results at the International Society for Autism Research (INSAR) 2024 Annual Meeting in an oral session titled "Differential Gaze Patterns in Autism While Watching Video Conversations: An Online Eye-Tracking Study".

## A Pre-registered experiment
Our team is currently working on a pre-registered experiment using the same paradigm. Stay tuned!
