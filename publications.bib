	abstract = {To navigate our complex social world, it is crucial to deploy multiple learning strategies, such as learning from directly experiencing action outcomes or from observing other people’s behavior. Despite the prevalence of experiential and observational learning in humans and other social animals, it remains unclear how people favor one strategy over the other depending on the environment, and how individuals vary in their strategy use. Here, we describe an arbitration mechanism in which the prediction errors associated with each learning strategy influence their weight over behavior. We designed an online behavioral task to test our computational model, and found that while a substantial proportion of participants relied on the proposed arbitration mechanism, there was some meaningful heterogeneity in how people solved this task. Four other groups were identified: those who used a fixed mixture between the two strategies, those who relied on a single strategy and non-learners with irrelevant strategies. Furthermore, groups were found to differ on key behavioral signatures, and on transdiagnostic symptom dimensions, in particular autism traits and anxiety. Together, these results demonstrate how large heterogeneous datasets and computational methods can be leveraged to better characterize individual differences.},

	abstract = {The ability to infer the goals and intentions of others is crucial for social interactions, and such social capabilities are broadly distributed across individuals. Autism-like traits (that is, traits associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)) have been associated with reduced social inference, yet the underlying computational principles and social cognitive processes are not well characterized. Here we tackle this problem by investigating inference during social learning through computational modeling in two large cross-sectional samples of adult participants from the general population (N1 = 943, N2 = 352). Autism-like traits were extracted and isolated from other associated symptom dimensions through a factor analysis of the Social Responsiveness Scale. Participants completed an observational learning task to quantify the tradeoff between two social learning strategies: imitation (repeating the observed partner’s most recent action) and emulation (inferring the observed partner’s goal). Autism-like traits were associated with reduced observational learning specifically through reduced emulation (but not imitation), revealing difficulties in social goal inference (Pearson’s r = −0.124, P {\textless} 0.001). This association held, even when controlling for other model parameters (for example, decision noise, heuristics, F1,925 = 15.352, P {\textless} 0.001), and was specifically related to social difficulties in autism-like traits (F1,916 = 33.169, P {\textless} 0.001) but not social anxiety traits (F1,916 = 0.005, P = 0.945). The findings, replicated in an additional sample, provide a powerfully specific mechanistic hypothesis for social learning challenges in ASD, employing a computational psychiatry approach that could be applied to other disorders.},

	abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with graph theoretical modeling has been increasingly applied for assessing whole brain network topological organization, yet its reproducibility remains controversial. In this study, we acquired three repeated resting-state fMRI scans from 16 healthy controls during a strictly controlled in-laboratory study and examined the test-retest reliability of seven global and three nodal brain network metrics using different data processing and modeling strategies. Among the global network metrics, the characteristic path length exhibited the highest reliability, whereas the network small-worldness performed the poorest. Nodal efficiency was the most reliable nodal metric, whereas betweenness centrality showed the lowest reliability. Weighted global network metrics provided better reliability than binary metrics, and reliability from the AAL90 atlas outweighed those from the Power264 parcellation. Although global signal regression had no consistent effects on the reliability of global network metrics, it slightly impaired the reliability of nodal metrics. These findings provide important implications for the future utility of graph theoretical modeling in brain network analyses.},

	abstract = {Atypical gaze patterns are a promising biomarker of autism spectrum disorder. To measure gaze accurately, however, it typically requires highly controlled studies in the laboratory using specialized equipment that is often expensive, thereby limiting the scalability of these approaches. Here we test whether a recently developed smartphone-based gaze estimation method could overcome such limitations and take advantage of the ubiquity of smartphones. As a proof-of-principle, we measured gaze while a small sample of well-assessed autistic participants and controls watched videos on a smartphone, both in the laboratory (with lab personnel) and in remote home settings (alone). We demonstrate that gaze data can be efficiently collected, in-home and longitudinally by participants themselves, with sufficiently high accuracy (gaze estimation error below 1° visual angle on average) for quantitative, feature-based analysis. Using this approach, we show that autistic individuals have reduced gaze time on human faces and longer gaze time on non-social features in the background, thereby reproducing established findings in autism using just smartphones and no additional hardware. Our approach provides a foundation for scaling future research with larger and more representative participant groups at vastly reduced cost, also enabling better inclusion of underserved communities.},

	abstract = {The surge of online psychological assessments have brought the autism research community both opportunities and challenges: while they enable rapid large-scale data collection and more power to characterize individual differences, they also bring concerns about data quality, generalizability beyond online samples, and whether autistic traits can be reliably characterized with self-report measures administered online. Here we tackle these concerns by providing a systematic characterization of the autistic traits variability across individuals in a large cross-sectional dataset (N=2826) as well as its temporal reliability within individuals in a test-retest dataset (N=247), with both online and in-lab samples. We measured autistic traits using the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd version, Adult Self Report (SRS-2-ASR) - a tool that quantifies individual differences in autistic traits along a continuum for the general adult population. Across individuals, we found elevated SRS scores in online samples and were able to trace this effect to specific subsets of SRS items. SRS scores also covaried with internalizing symptoms, decreased with age, and were lower in women compared to other genders. Within individuals, we find moderate-to-good test-retest reliability of SRS scores over long intervals, with no difference between online and in-lab samples, suggesting robust temporal stability. We conclude that there are systematic differences in autistic traits between online and in-lab samples that are partly explained by systematic population-level differences in internalizing symptoms, particularly social anxiety. Future studies that sample across different populations should measure, control for, or stratify with respect to these factors.},

	abstract = {Traits are patterns of brain signals and behaviors that are stable over time but differ across individuals, whereas states are phasic patterns that vary over time, are influenced by the environment, yet oscillate around the traits. The quality of a social interaction depends on the traits and states of the interacting agents. However, it remains unclear how to decipher both traits and states from the same set of brain signals. To explore the hidden neural traits and states in relation to the behavioral ones during social interactions, we developed a pipeline to extract latent dimensions of the brain from electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected during a team flow task. Our pipeline involved two stages of dimensionality reduction: first, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), followed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This pipeline resulted in an interpretable, seven-dimensional EEG latent space that revealed a trait-state hierarchical structure, with macro-segregation capturing neural traits and micro-segregation capturing neural states. Out of the seven latent dimensions, we found that three that significantly contributed to variations across individuals and task states. Using representational similarity analysis, we mapped the EEG latent space to a skill-cognition space, establishing a connection between hidden neural signatures and social interaction behaviors. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of representing both traits and states within a single model that correlates with changes in social behavior.},
